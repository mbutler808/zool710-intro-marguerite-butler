    "text": "Four fun facts about me\n\nI love to cook and eat good food, when I have time. These days it is mostly on the weekends, when I get to share with my parents. I love to try new recipes, these days mostly from Korean or any Asian cuisine, Mexican, or Italian cuisines.\nI have one kid (senior in college! Yikes) and one puppy (turns 12 in January).\nI have done fieldwork in Hawaii, the Caribbean, North America, Central America, Southern Africa, Papua New Guinea, East Asia (Japan), and Australia. Still on my bucket list is Madagascar.\nI am involved with the Comparative Phylogenetics Methods in R community (here is a listerv)R-sig-phylo, and have contributed to the OUCH package in R. We are folks interested in learning by comparing species, analyzing data across phylogenetic trees."
