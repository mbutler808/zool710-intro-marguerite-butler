I love to try new recipes, these days mostly from Korean or any Asian cuisine, Mexican, or Italian cuisines.\nI have one kid (senior in college! Yikes) and one puppy (turns 12 in January).\nI have done fieldwork in Hawaii, the Caribbean, North America, Central America, Southern Africa, Papua New Guinea, East Asia (Japan), and Australia. Still on my bucket list is Madagascar.\nI am involved with the Comparative Phylogenetics Methods in R community (here is a listerv)R-sig-phylo, and have contributed to the OUCH package in R (Butler and King 2004; King and Butler 2009). We are folks interested in learning by comparing species, analyzing data across phylogenetic trees."
