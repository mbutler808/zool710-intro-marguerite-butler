# About me

Hello! I'm a Professor of Life Sciences at UH Manoa and a faculty member in the Zoology and Microbiology graduate programs. I am a biologist very interested in data science. My questions range from evolutionary biology to the comparative physiology of ectotherms (mostly frogs and lizards) and microbes.

## Four fun facts about me

1. I love to cook and eat good food, when I have time. These days it is mostly on the weekends, when I get to share with my parents. I love to try new recipes, these days mostly from Korean or any Asian cuisine, Mexican, or Italian cuisines.
2. I have one kid (senior in college! Yikes) and one puppy (turns 12 in January).
3. I have done fieldwork in Hawaii, the Caribbean, North America, Central America, Southern Africa, Papua New Guinea, East Asia (Japan), and Australia. Still on my bucket list is Madagascar.
4. I am involved with the Comparative Phylogenetics Methods in R community (here is a listerv)[R-sig-phylo](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-phylo), and have contributed to the [OUCH package in R](https://kingaa.github.io/ouch/) [@Butler:2004; @King:2009]. We are folks interested in learning by comparing species, analyzing data across phylogenetic trees.

## The Majesty of Wildlife

There is so much bad news these days. This year I wanted to see beauty. This is the stunning photo gallery of Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition from the Natural History Museum

## Papers with my students

I love to do research with my students. Here are a couple of papers that resulted from massive effort that IÊ»m particularly proud of. A phylogeny of the enigmatic Asterophryinae frogs of New Guinea, a hyperdiverse group with over 350 named species [@Hill:2022], and the accompanying data paper [@Hill:2022a].
